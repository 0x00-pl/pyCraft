When running start.py, make sure you duck.

#Requirements
- wxPython (In the requirements.txt for all you pip fans, however you can avoid this.)
- pyCrypto 2.5 (Also in requirements.txt)

#PyCrypto on Windows Systems (32 bit)
If you use Python 2.7 with win32 you're in luck, theres an installer right [here](http://www.secker.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pycrypto-2.5.win32-py2.7.exe) for pyCrypto 2.5
otherwise you're gonna need to compile it, followed by some fancy instructions on how to install pyCrypto over [here](http://www.secker.nl/2012/03/08/building-pycrypto-2-5-using-mingw-and-python-2-7-on-windows-xp/)

#Install things.
If the install fails for you, you can grab a binary of wxPython over at: [http://wxpython.org/download.php#stable]

Basically, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which should pull everything in. You need a compiler.

Eventually we'll put some run instructions here.

#Closing remarks
Have fun!

#TODO
- Overhaul GUI
(in case you haven't figured out already, I suck at GUIs in python. If you know what you're doing and wanna contribute, I'd appreciate some help :3)
