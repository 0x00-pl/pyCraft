Minecraft Python Client!

When running start.py, make sure you duck.

#Requirements
- wxPython (In the requirements.txt for all you pip fans, however you can avoid this.)

If the install fails for you, you can grab a binary of wxPython over at: [http://wxpython.org/download.php#stable]

Basically, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, which should pull everything in. You need a compiler.

Eventually we'll put some run instructions here.

Have fun!

#TODO
- Overhaul GUI
(in case you haven't figured out already, I suck at GUIs in python. If you know what you're doing and wanna contribute, I'd appreciate some help :3)
